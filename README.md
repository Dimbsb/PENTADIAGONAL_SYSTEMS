# PENTADIAGONAL_SYSTEMS

This project focuses on solving pentadiagonal systems. In reality, a comparison is made between the gaussianElimination, matlab, cramer 
and the ptransii algorithm (https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2015/232456.pdf) in order to find the best (fastest) one for solving such systems. 
Also in the code output, the relevant graphical representations of the comparisons are also made visible. 
The samples were taken from several different dimensions of the problem.
